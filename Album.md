## Twilight

- The perfect twilight

 Twilight in Australia, above the Northern Teritory, photo shot on 09/26/2011. The plain cruised at an altitude of obout 37100 feet (11300 meters). The local time is 5:56AM, the sun will after 25 minutes. The impressive skyline is so straight, makes the boundary of the sky and the earth clear and tidy. However, it is NOT the skyline, it the top of the cloud, may be the stratocumulus, or the altocumulus, who knows...
