## Research Interests

Microwave Photonics (MWPs) is one of the most focused area in the field of electronic engineering. It combines both the microwave frequency and the light frequency, enables the collision between electrons and photons, and emerges lots of breakthroughs and possiblities for applications. 

The photonic technology has many advantages that contributes to microwave, including low loss while long transfer, immunity to electronic and magnetic interference, large bandwidth, light weight and small volume. On the otherhand, the well studied microwave technology bring many fine testing and measuring techniques to photonics, and further enhanced the study of photonic technology. 

In MWP, highlight topics include transmission, generation, detection, measuring and processing of microwave signals. What I focused on cover mainly all the subjects. 

Transmission is the basic function of MWP system.
